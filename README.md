# Climate Cardinals Newsletter Automation

Automated weekly climate intelligence newsletter system.

## Features
- Daily scraping (Tuesday–Sunday)
- Weekly email digest (Monday)
- Weekly static site deployed with GitHub Pages
- Header and email layout now scale correctly on mobile devices (responsive CSS added)
- Zero maintenance required after initial setup

## Setup
1. Add GitHub Secrets:
   - `SENDER_EMAIL`
   - `SENDER_PASSWORD`
   - `RECIPIENT_EMAILS`
   - `WEB_REPORT_BASE_URL`

2. (Optional) if you still have a Netlify site, go to the dashboard and disable automatic builds or delete the site entirely. The repo no longer needs Netlify and there are no build credits required.

3. Push to GitHub – the existing `newsletter.yml` workflow will continue sending emails; the new `weekly-report.yml` workflow will regenerate and publish static HTML every Monday.

   *Emails generated by `newsletter.yml` no longer use the dated report for the top "View full report" button; that button now points at the `index.html` page (which is guaranteed to exist, preventing 404s).  However, the individual section buttons (grants, events, etc.) still jump straight into the current week's report file.  This gives readers quick access to the relevant section while avoiding a broken top‑level link. If a section link is clicked before the report has been deployed, it may briefly 404 until the Monday job completes.*

4. Enable GitHub Pages (if not already set).
   - In your repository settings, go to **Pages**.
   - **Source** must be set to the **gh-pages** branch and **/ (root)** folder – this is where the weekly workflow publishes the generated HTML. If the branch is empty or missing, run the `Weekly report deployment` workflow once manually (see Actions tab) and it will create and populate the branch.
   - Save; the site will then show the report instead of the README. The URL will be `https://<your‑user>.github.io/<repo>` or your custom domain.
   - If you previously pointed a custom domain to Netlify, update the DNS records to point at GitHub Pages instead (or remove them to let the default URL work).
